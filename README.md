## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment (DONE)
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package. (DONE)
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual (idk)
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
Our assignment is the creation of an audio visualiser using Digital Audio Processing in Java. We mapped lines and shapes to the sound waves and frequency of the song Boy's A Liar Pt.2 by PinkPantheress ft. Ice Spice. We used a variety of visuals in order to capture the mood and energy of the song. The core theme of our visuals is the use of a pink heart. It represents the lyrics of the song and also the singer PinkPantheress. Orange is used to rperesent Ice Spice.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
